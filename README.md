## Customization

### Adding New Indices

To add new indices to the market summary, edit the `indices` array in the `TradingDashboard` component:

```javascript
const indices = [
  // ... existing indices
  { name: 'New Index', value: 1000.00, change: 0.5, color: 'green', flag: 'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸' },
];
```

### Modifying the Watchlist

To modify the watchlist, edit the `watchlistItems` array in the `TradingDashboard` component:

```javascript
const watchlistItems = [
  // ... existing items
  { symbol: 'NEW', price: 100.00, change: 1.5, color: 'green' },
];
```
